These are legally enforceable under civil law.\nPrivate parking charges, on the other hand, are issued by private companies for parking rule breaches on private land (like supermarkets or hospital car parks). While they may look official, they are not the same as council-issued PCNs and are considered civil contracts, not legal penalties.\nKey differences:\n\uD83D\uDC49 Issuer: Council or transport authority (PCN) vs private company (private charge)\n\uD83D\uDC49 Enforceability: PCNs can lead to bailiff action if unpaid; private fines require a court claim\n\uD83D\uDC49 Appeal process: PCNs follow a regulated appeal system; private charges depend on the company and may use independent bodies like POPLA or IAS."
